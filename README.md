# GENE367
This repository has been created for the Genetics and Molecular Biology Laboratory Course (GENE 367) by Umut Akg√ºl. The primary purpose is to share the R script codes that were utilized in the Transmission Genetics Report for the lab course. 
For the second part of the laboratory, we created a smooth plot and histogram from the "mock_data_gene367.xlsx" file. The primarily used package was ggplot2. 
For the evolution part of the laboratory, from the data named "gene_367_evolution.xlsx," which is the mtDNA sequence data of the Eurasian Golden Tomby species in 4 different mainland islands. We created a phylogenetic tree of them by using "ape," "FD,""readxl" and "tidyverse" packages.
